Repository for team projects in NAU's Computer Networks course

## Projects
* Daytime Client/Server
  * The Daytime Client/Server project is a simple network application that demonstrates the client-server architecture and basic socket programming. The server listens on a predefined port and sends the current date and time to any client that connects.
* 3A + 1 Client/Server
  *  The 3A + 1 Client/Server project is a simple yet powerful implementation of the famous Collatz Conjecture, built using a client-server architecture in C programming language. The client sends an integer value to the server, which then performs the 3A + 1 algorithm on the number and sends back the result. 
* Chat Application
  * Simple command-line interface (CLI) program written in C that enables users to chat with each other over a network. It utilizes a client-server architecture and features multithreaded client and server components, allowing for concurrent communication between multiple clients and the server. Users can join the chat room by connecting to the server and send messages to other connected users in real-time.
